## Submission Instructions

### Overview
    I would like to create an app that keeps track of both gifts given and gifts received.  The app will keep track of a location, price, and who the gift is for if the gift hasn't been given yet.  So for instance, if you bought a gift for someone months before a birthday or holiday, you could go look and see who it's for and what you spent on it.
	The app will also keep track of what has been given to you and by whom.  This feature is so that you can check if you are consistenly giving gifts that are more expensive or giving gifts to people who don't reciprocate at all.
	I would also like to add a feature that will allow the user to add a picture if it's feasible to do so.
### Features
    1.  User login-- This will allow multiple users to use the app.
	2.  Given/Received--  This will allow a user to check whether the gift was given or received.
	3.  Name of giver or receiver--  This will allow the user to enter the name of the person who is
	getting the gift or who gave you the gift.
	4.  Input Gift Name--  This will allow the user to input a gift.
	5.  Input Price--  This will allow a user to keep track of they spent on each gift.
	6.  Input Description--  This will allow a user to enter a brief description of the items.
	7.  Input Date--  This will allow a user to select a date for the item to be given or the date it
	was received.
### Technologies
    1.  Java.
	2.  Javascript.
	3.  SpringBoot.
	4.  MySql.
	5.  Html/Css.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn some JavaScript integration into a SpringBoot app.  I know very little CSS and will have to spend time looking up its various uses.  Also,  I'm still very unsure of SpringBoot itself.
